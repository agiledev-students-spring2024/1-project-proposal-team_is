## Project Title 
Auditory Cheesecake

## What is this? 
Throughout history, psychologists and philosophers have debated the following question: does music shape society or does society shape its music? 

There is no doubt that music has evolved over time. Therefore, we can say that it has evolved with our changing societies (ie: your parents often don't share the same taste in music as you). Plato and Aristotle argued that music shapes society and that bad music can be detrimental to mankind. However, contemporary psychologists, such as Steven Pinker, claim that music is like auditory cheesecake, in that it is biologically useless and manifests as the byproduct of other evolved phenomena. 

There is more data that suggests that society shapes music, and our app is built on this fundamental idea. Our goal is to allow individuals to gain insights into their personalities by evaluating their unique music tastes. For this project, we will be developing algorithms to help us do just that and providing our users with an interactive and engaging user-facing tool to do so. 

Our models of assessment that we are using to create our algorithms are based on research data that we have collected at the NYU Fox Lab. We hope that our understanding of how music impacts personalities can serve as a means to evaluate personalities of other individuals, thereby having tangible real-world applications.

## Who is this for? 
This app would primarily be aimed for college students, as the underlying data that influences our algorithms is based primarily on them. 

## How would it Work? 
1) Our users to listen to specific songs.
2) Our users will answer questions about the music they are listening to, along with other related ethical questions.
4) We will analyze their song choice by applying our algorithms of assessment.
5) After assessing their information, we will present their personality profile to the user
6) We will have an interactive profile where the individual can learn more about their music taste and how it relates to their personality.
