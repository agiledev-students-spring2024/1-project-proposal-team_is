## Project Title 
Auditory Cheesecake

## What is this? 
For a long time, psychologists and philosophers have debated the following: does music shape society or does society shape its music. There is no doubt that music has evolved over time, and in such, we can say that it has evolved with our society (e.g your parents often don't have the same taste in music as you). Plato and Aristotle argued that music shapes society and bad that music can be detrimental to mankind. However, contemporary psychologists, such as Steven Pinker, claim that music is like auditory cheesecake (in that it is biologically useless and manifests as the byproduct of other evolved phenomena). There is more data that suggests that society shapes music, and our app is built on this fundamental idea. Our goal is to allow individuals to gain an insight into their personalities through music. We will be developing algorithms to help us do just that, which are based on research data that we have collected at the NYU Fox lab. We hope that our understanding of how music impacts personalities can serve as a means to evaluate personalities of other individuals, thereby having real-world practical applications. 

## Who is this for? 
This app would primarily be aimed for college students, as the underlying data that influences our algorithms is based primarily on them. 

## How would it Work? 
1) Listen to songs (We will analyze which ones are the most effective from the 2 hour study we have participants partake in)
2) They will answer questions about the music and other ethical questions as well. 
3)
