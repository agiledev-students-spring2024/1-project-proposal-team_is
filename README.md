## Project Title 
Auditory Cheesecake

## What is this? 
For a long time, psychologists, and philosophers have debated the question: does music shape society or does society shape its music. There is no doubt that music has evolved over time and in such we can say it has evolved with society (e.g your parents often don't have the same taste in music as you). Plato and Aristotle argued that music shapes society and bad music can be detrimental. However, contemporary psychologists like Steven Pinker claim music is like auditory cheesecake (it's biologically useless). There is more data that suggests society shapes music so our app is built on this idea. We would like to use music as a way to give people an insight into their personality. In a research lab we are a part of, Fox Lab, we have been running a study and developing algorithms that can help us to just that. We hope to develop the platform that can have real implications. 

## Who is this for? 
This app would primarily be aimed for college students as the underlying data is mostly focused on them 

## How would it Work? 
1) Listen to songs (We will analyze which ones are the most effective from the 2 hour study we have participants partake in)
2) They will answer questions about the music and other ethical questions as well. 
3) 

## Process
