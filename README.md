## Project Title 
Auditory Cheesecake

## What and Why?
Throughout history, psychologists and philosophers have debated the following question: does music shape society or does society shape its music? 

There is no doubt that music has evolved over time. Therefore, we can say that it has evolved with our changing societies (ie: your parents often don't share the same taste in music as you). Plato and Aristotle argued that music shapes society and that bad music can be detrimental to mankind. However, contemporary psychologists, such as Steven Pinker, claim that music is like auditory cheesecake, in that it is biologically useless and manifests as the byproduct of other evolved phenomena. 

There is more data that suggests that society shapes music, and our app is built on this fundamental idea. Our goal is to allow individuals to gain insights into their personalities by evaluating their unique music tastes. For this project, we will be developing algorithms to help us do just that and providing our users with an interactive and engaging user-facing tool to do so. 

Our models of assessment that we are using to create our algorithms are based on research data that we have collected at the NYU Fox Lab. We hope that our understanding of how music impacts personalities can serve as a means to evaluate personalities of other individuals, thereby having tangible real-world applications.

## For Whom?
This app is primarily aimed for use by college students who are looking to gain insights about their personalities based on their music tastes. Since our underlying data that influences our algorithms is based on the college student demographic, this target audience would allow for the fairest assessment.

## How?
1) Our users create their user profiles by entering their personal information into the system.
2) Our users to listen to specific songs chosen from the study (to allow for a fair mode of assessment). We will have to do statistical analysis to figure out which songs are the most relevant in what we are accomplishing. 
3) Our users will answer questions about the music they are listening to, along with other related ethical questions.
4) We will analyze their song choice by applying our algorithms of assessment to their answers. 
5) After assessing their information, we will present their personality profile to the user.
6) Their user profile will be updated to reflect the findings. The interactive profile will allow the individual to learn more about their music taste and how it relates to their personality.

## Preliminary process 
1) Create a user management system (frontend + backend + REST)
  - Login
  - Register
  - Email/sms authentication
2) Create corresponding screens for user management (frontend + backend + REST)
  - View user profile
  - Update user profile
  - Change user password
3) Create backend algorithms of assessment
  - Analyze Fox Lab data
  - Create algorithms based on data analysis work
  - Identify relationships between music and personality for each user
4) Potentially allow for the integration of other assessment-style questionnaires
5) Present results to our participants. 

## Scope
Our goal is to make our web application fully functioning, user friendly, interactive, and engaging. This can be achieved through the use of elegant and contemporary colors, engaging visuals, and other interactive features for our users. Our algorithms of assessment will also require a great deal of sophisiticated data processing, along with a fine-tuned method of assessment. While this project will require a great deal of effort, especially in terms of creating our algorihtm on the backend and customizing our user experience, it is completely doable with effort, team work, and employing agile software devleopment practices.
